# World-mental-health-data-sharing-program
We hope that mental health experts and machine learning developers around the world can work together to reduce the cost of mental health diagnosis through artificial intelligence, so that mental health diagnosis is not only the privilege of a few people, but also the vast number of low-income people can enjoy mental health services. In the first phase of the project, we expect to share the mental health diagnosis data so that the mental health data can support the number of samples needed for deep learning.  
我们希望全世界的心理健康专家与机器学习开发者可以合作起来，通过人工智能的方法降低心理健康的诊断成本，使得心理健康诊断不仅仅是少数人的特权，广大的低收入人群也可以享受心理健康的服务。 在该项目的第一期，我们期望可以共享心理健康的诊断数据，使得心理健康数据足以支持深度学习所需的样本数量。
We hope that the information uploaded includes the real mental health diagnosis information after desensitization
我们希望上传的信息包括经过脱敏后的真实的心理健康诊断信息
